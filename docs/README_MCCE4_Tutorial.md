# Welcome to MCCE tutorial

MCCE starts with atomic coordinates in PDB format.  The output includes:
ALWAYS
  The protonation states of all Asp, Glu, Arg, Lys, His, Tyr, Cys (and His tautomer) at a pH of interest. 
  The pKa of these residues
  Information about why pKas are shifted within the protein from the values of the isolated resides in solution. 

ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS 
  Analaysis of microstates generated in Monte Carlo sampling. There are tools to handel the microstate output.
  
WITH APPROPRIATE TOPOLOGY FILE (.tpl)
  Redox potententials at equilbriu with residue and cofactor protonation states.
  Ion binding.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This tutorial will show you how to set up, run and interprete the results for the PDB file 4lzt (Hen Egg White Lysozyme).  MCCE must be installed. 

EACH MCCE RUN IS DESIGNED TO RUN IN ITS OWN DIRECTORY.  If you run a new protein or change conditions make a new directory.

(If you're new to LINUX - Copy and past the following code into a terminal:
 > mkdir 4PTI 
 > cd 4PTI
 > getpdb 4PTI
 > ls
"mkdir" creates the new folder/directory "4PTI" to work in, and "cd" changes directory to 4PTI. "getpdb" is a utility distributed with MCCE that downlads the PDB file from RCSB.org, and "ls" lists the new files in our directory. 
)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

FIND OUT HOW MCCE VIEWS YOUR PROTEIN BEFORE YOU RUN IT

>p_info.py 4lzt.pdb

p_info.py will tell you
(1) how big your protein is.  Then look at  timing data _ to see if it's minutes or hours;  
(2) if there are ligands that the program doesn't recognize. (What to do with unkown ligands ___).
(3) If MCCE is modifying your protein.  For example, it will make an the N- and C termini ionizable.  

RUN MCCE

>run_mcce 4lzt.pdb > run.log &

KEY OUTPUT FILES

fort.38 > sum_crg.out > pK.out

pK.out has information about how the protein shifts the pK or each residue.  To start you can edit the file with 

To get the pK simply 
>cut -c1-48 pK.out

or 
>cut -c1-48 pK.out | sort
The sort will grop each residue type.  In  s hoof tun most residues should have pKs near their values in solution.  All Arg should have high pKs.  

If we look at pK.out Lys 1. This titration is close to ideal. 
    Output : [LYS+A0001_        9.545     0.988     0.002]
The pK is 9.545, 
The n value is 0.935 (1 is ideal). (the Henderson Hendersonâ€“Hasselbalch equation (10^(n(pK-pH))/[1+10^(n(pK-pH))]
The sum of the squared differences of the calculated points from an ideal titration curve is 0.002 (1000*chi2).  

MCCE calculated the pK using the data in sum_crg.out (I've deleted the NTR line)
MCCE equilbrated the protein from pH 0 to 14. This gives the carge as a function of the pH.  The probability of being ionized as a fundtion of pH --> pK
 pH           0     1     2     3     4     5     6     7     8     9    10    11    12    13    14
LYS+A0001_  1.00  1.00  1.00  1.00  1.00  1.00  1.00  1.00  0.97  0.77  0.27  0.04  0.00  0.00  0.00

If chi^2 is greater than 5 you should graph sum_crg.out vs pH for that residue.  The pK fit to a single titration may not be appropriate for this residue. So the pK in pK.out is no long a good measure of the MCCE titration.  

Sum_crg.out give the charge at each pH.  It is derived from fort.38 which gives the % of each conformer at each pH.  Here there is only 1 ionized Lys conformand 1 neutral Lys conformer.  the sum of all conformers of a residue =1.00.  

ph              0.0   1.0   2.0   3.0   4.0   5.0   6.0   7.0   8.0   9.0  10.0  11.0  12.0  13.0  14.0

The pK.out file for 4lzt should be close to this.  The values will not be exactly the same.  
pKas >14.0 (or <0.0) are out of the range of the titration. The titration range can be modified.

MCCE IS MODULAR AND CAN BE STOPPED AND MODIFIED AFTER EACH OF THE 4 STEPS.
All steps should be run in 1 directory.  Step(n) needs output of step(n-1).
Step1: read in and fix the file
Step2: make conformers using the sinstructions in head1.lst
Step3: Calculat self and pairwise interactions for all conformes in step2_out.pdb
Step4: Run MC (can control pH or eH limits of titration; can fix individual conformers on or off)

  BREAKDOWN OF 4 MCCE STEPS

```
>step1.py 4pti.pdb --dry
```

"step1.py 4lzt.pdb" begins by reformatting the PDB file. The "--dry" flag removes waters, which we suggest you do if you are calculating pKs, Kds or Ems.  If you are looking for hydrogen bond networks you need the waters. 

```
>step2.py
```

"step2.py" finds "step1_out.pdb" 
Step 2 of MCCE makes conformers for all residues and ligands.  Topology files indicate the making of different protonation and redox states as well as whether ligands can leave the protein.  The default sidechain rotomer making is 'isosteric' which does not rotate C-C boinds in side chains.  This changes hydroxyl positions, flips ASN and GLN amide dide chain oritentation and makes both neutral His tautomers.    .

```
>step3.py
```


"step3.py" computes the energy lookup table for the protein, and is the most computationally expensive part of MCCE. 

```
step4.py --xts
ls
```

"step4.py" is the last step we will look at. It uses Monte Carlo sampling to compute pKa values based on the output of Step 3, head3.lst. You will now have about 24 files in your directory, but we're most interested in "pK.out".
