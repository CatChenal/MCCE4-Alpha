## Welcome to the **MCCE4-Alpha**! 
üöÄ **Get Started Now:**  [**MCCE4 Tutorial & Guide Website**](https://gunnerlab.github.io/mcce4_tutorial/)

In this tutorial guides you through calculating and analyzing electrostatic interactions from a PDB structure.
Here, we provide step-by-step practical examples designed to help new users quickly run simulations and understand key features of MCCE4.

## **Quick Introduction**

Given the structure of a macromolucule (in a PDB file), **MCCE4** can predict the following:

- **pK‚Çê values**
- **Protonation states**
- **Electrostatic properties** of biomolecules

In this program, protein side chain motions are simulated explicitly while the dielectric effect of solvent and bulk protein material is modeled by continuum electrostatics.

## **Documentation Overview**
Comprehensive documentation covering:
- Installation
- Gudie: Detailed explanations of all settings
- Example Projects 

## Help us improve MCCE4
This is a testing version of MCCE4 development. 
Please let us know about questions, comments or report any issues you encounter [here](https://github.com/GunnerLab/MCCE4-Alpha/issues).
Thank You and we hope you enjoy using MCCE4!
