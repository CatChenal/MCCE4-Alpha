## **Quick Introduction**

Given the structure of a macromolucule (in a PDB file), **MCCE4** can predict the following:

- **pK‚Çê values**
- **Protonation states**
- **Electrostatic properties** of biomolecules

In this program, protein side chain motions are simulated explicitly while the dielectric effect of solvent and bulk protein material is modeled by continuum electrostatics.

## **Documentation Overview**
Comprehensive documentation covering:
- Installation
- Guide: Detailed explanations of all settings
- Example Projects 

## Help us improve MCCE4
