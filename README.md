# MCCE4-Alpha

ALPHA MCCE version development. In this development cycle, code **will** be pure Python except PBE solver, for the benefit of
* flexible concept prototyping
* quick developing
* available functions already in NumPy and SciPy

## MCCE4 Project Essential Links

MCCE4 will stay as a private repository that only lab members and collaborators can see. A public version will be released separately. 

* [Repository](https://github.com/GunnerLab/MCCE4) - where you get and deposit code
* [Project](https://github.com/orgs/GunnerLab/projects/4) - automated project monitoring
* [Documentation](doc) - a place that makes your code actually usable
  * [Feature Requests](doc/Features.md)
  * [Developer Manual](doc/DevManual.md)
  * [User Manual](doc/UserManual.md)

* [Discussions](https://github.com/GunnerLab/MCCE4/discussions) - discussion board for anything

## Installation Guide

Git clone MCCE4-Alpha to a desired place on your computer. For ease of use, we recommend adding to the path in your ".bashrc" file. Use vi or nano to open your ".bashrc" file. If MCCE4-Alpha was located in /gunnerlab/, you would add the following lines:

```
export PATH=/home/gunnerlab/MCCE4-Alpha/bin:$PATH
export PATH=/home/gunnerlab/MCCE4-Alpha/MCCE_bin:$PATH
```

The important thing is that both the /bin/ and /MCCE_bin/ folders are referenced and accessible. Now, use command "source .bashrc". Commands like "step1.py", "p_info.py" should now be accessible- try using "which step1.py". If the command returns the path to MCCE4-Alpha/bin, you'll know it worked. 
Enjoy trying MCCE4-Alpha!

## MCCE4 Updates

### ðŸ”¹ Poisson-Boltzmann Solvers in MCCE4  
MCCE4 now supports multiple **Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) solvers**, offering flexibility in electrostatic calculations. While **Delphi remains the default PB solver**, we have integrated **NextGenPB (NGPB) from the Rocchia Lab (IIT)** and **Zap TK from OpenEye Scientific** as additional options for enhanced performance and accuracy.  

ðŸš€ **Upcoming Change:** In the near future, **NextGenPB (NGPB) will become the default PB solver** in MCCE4.  

---

### ðŸ”¹ Delphi (Default)  
The standard PB solver used in MCCE4. Well-established for electrostatic calculations.  

### ðŸ”¹ NextGenPB (NGPB) - Rocchia Lab (IIT)
Developed by [Vincenzo di Florio](https://github.com/vdiflorio) at the [Rocchia Lab](https://github.com/concept-lab), IIT Genova, Italy.  
**Upcoming:** A Docker container is being built for easier deployment. **Stay tuned!** ðŸš€

### ðŸ”¹ Zap TK - OpenEye Scientific 
To use **Zap TK**, you must obtain an **OpenEye license**:  
ðŸ”— [Request a License](https://www.eyesopen.com/contact)  

Add your license file to your PATH in your .bashrc file
```
export OE_LICENSE=/home/mcce/openeye/oe_license.txt
```

##### Installation Instructions  
Follow the OpenEye Toolkit installation guide:  
ðŸ”— [Quickstart Guide](https://docs.eyesopen.com/toolkits/python/quickstart-python/linuxosx.html)  

We recommend using a dedicated Conda environment:  
```
conda create -n oepython -c openeye openeye-toolkits python=3.10
conda install numpy scipy matplotlib pygraphviz pandas xlrd openpyxl requests
```

Test if your license and isntallation are working:
```
oecheminfo.py
```

Zap is run at MCCE4 step3, and can be called as follows (we recommend salt concentration set 0.05 for best results):
```
step3.py -s zap -salt 0.05
```


## Transition stage
Transition stage is when c code version mcce coexists with python mcce4. In this transition statge, you will need to compile the program:

```
cd your_MCCE4_path
make clean
make
```

Make sure to add both paths, bin and MCCE_bin, to you environment variable PATH. If a program are in both bin folders, bin/ has higher priority. Once we fully tested the newer version, the old one will be removed. 
```
export PATH=your_MCCE4_path/bin:your_MCCE4_path/MCCE_bin:$PATH
```

## Latest updates
- 03/17/2025 MCCE4-Alpha has been created for testing distribution
- 05/31/2024 Stable-MCCE is merged to this repository.
- 06/06/2004 Torsion energy is restored to C code algorithm.
