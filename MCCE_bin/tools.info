Tools in MCCE4/MCCE_bin - Last updated: 06/12/25.

Note: Tools prefixed with "ms-" process the microstate file.

- bench_setup    :: Setup a dataset for multiple runs & write 'prerun' report.
                 + 4 sub-commands:
                  0. "pdbids"
                      To show & save the list of available pdbids.
                      
                  1. "pkdb_pdbs"
                      Sub-command for setting up <bench_dir>/runs folder
                      using the pdbs in pKaDBv1 & job_name_run.sh script.

                  2. "user_pdbs"
                       Sub-command for setting up <bench_dir>/runs folder
                      using the user's pdbs & job_name_run.sh script.

                  3. "launch"
                      Sub-command for scheduling the processing of the set.
                      Can be by-passed if 1. or 2. have the --launch flag, meaning 'launch now';
                      => No chance to review the pre-run report!
  
- bench_analyze  :: Do "intrinsic" analysis of a set of runs.
                 + 2 sub-commands: 1. "pkdb_pdbs", 2. "user_pdbs", as above.

- bench_compare  :: Do "extrinsic" comparison of 2 sets of runs.

- bench_batch    :: Submit a batch of N (10) runs [to be used if scheduler fails].

- glossary       :: Query a glossary of MCCE parameters.
                    - Search is case-sensitive!
                    - To query for a specific step, the query should be 'StepN', e.g. Step0.

- ms_hbnets1_mspdbs :: Generate a random sample of MCCE microstates in pdb format.
                       Minimal usage: ms_hbnets1_mspdbs

- ms_hbnets2_hah    :: Compute all possible hbonds over a collection directory of step2_out formatted pdbs
                       using the MCCE_bin.detect_hbonds.detect_hbonds function.
                       Each pdb will have its own associated txt file containing their hbond donors,
                       acceptors, distances and angles.

- ms_hbnets3_net    :: list_hbond_networks

- ms_hbnets4_stats  :: Analyze network similarites/statistics across a collection directory of microstate
                       associated network files.

- ms_protonation :: Obtain Protonation Microstates Analysis with Weighted Correlation
                    The requied input is a parameter file of which two examples can be found
                    in MCCE4-Alpha/runprms: 'params.crgms' and 'minimal_no_bounds.crgms'.

- ms_sample2pdbs    :: Generate a random sample of MCCE microstates in mcce pdb format.
                     Minimal usage: ms_sample_to_pdbs

- ms_top2pdbs    :: Create pdb & pqr files for the topN tautomeric protonation microstates,
                    along with a summary file & a listing of the N charge vectors.
                    Defaults:
                    pH=7.0; n_top=5; min_occ=0.0; residue_kinds=ionizable res; --overwrite=False.
                    Examples:
                     > ms_top2pdbs         # use all defaults
                     > ms_top2pdbs -eh 30  # Eh titration at ph7
                    Passing residues kinds: comma-separated; order & case insensitive:
                     > ms_top2pdbs -residue_kinds _CL,his,GLU

- postrun           :: Flags problem residues: non-canonical charge, high chi^2 or no fit.

- precheck       :: Simple check pdb information.

- protinfo       :: Parse pdb structure, run step1.py and parse log to create report.
