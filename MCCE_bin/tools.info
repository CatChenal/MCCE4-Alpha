Tools in MCCE4/MCCE_bin - Last updated: 04/08/25:
  - bench_setup    :: Setup a dataset for multiple runs & write 'prerun' report.
                + 4 sub-commands:
                  0. "pdbids"
                      To show & save the list of available pdbids.
                      
                  1. "pkdb_pdbs"
                      Sub-command for setting up <bench_dir>/runs folder
                      using the pdbs in pKaDBv1 & job_name_run.sh script.

                  2. "user_pdbs"
                      Sub-command for setting up <bench_dir>/runs folder
                      using the user's pdbs & job_name_run.sh script.

                  3. "launch"
                      Sub-command for scheduling the processing of the set.
                      Can be by-passed if 1. or 2. have the --launch flag, meaning 'launch now';
                      => No chance to review the pre-run report!
  
  - bench_analyze  :: Do "intrinsic" analysis of a set of runs.
                 + 2 sub-commands: 1. "pkdb_pdbs", 2. "user_pdbs", as above.
  - bench_compare  :: Do "extrinsic" comparison of 2 sets of runs.
  - bench_batch    :: Submit a batch of N (10) runs [to be used if scheduler fails].

  - glossary       :: Query a glossary of MCCE parameters.
                      - Search is case-sensitive!
                      - To query for a specific step, the query should be 'StepN', e.g. Step0.
  - ms_protonation :: Obtain Protonation Microstates Analysis with Weighted Correlation
                      The requied input is a parameter file of which two examples can be found
                      in MCCE4-Alpha/runprms: 'params.crgms' and 'minimal_no_bounds.crgms'.

  - precheck       :: Simple check pdb information.

  - protinfo       :: Parse pdb structure, run step1.py and parse log to create report.
