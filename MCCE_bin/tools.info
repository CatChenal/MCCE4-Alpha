Tools in MCCE4/MCCE_bin - Last updated: 07/5/24:
  - bench_setup    :: Setup a dataset for multiple runs & write 'prerun' report.
                + 4 sub-commands:
                  0. "pdbids"
                      To show & save the list of available pdbids.
                      
                  1. "pkdb_pdbs"
                      Sub-command for setting up <bench_dir>/runs folder
                      using the pdbs in pKaDBv1 & job_name_run.sh script.

                  2. "user_pdbs"
                      Sub-command for setting up <bench_dir>/runs folder
                      using the user's pdbs & job_name_run.sh script.

                  3. "launch"
                      Sub-command for scheduling the processing of the set.
                      Can be by-passed if 1. or 2. have the --launch flag, meaning 'launch now';
                      => No chance to review the pre-run report!
  
  - bench_analyze  :: Do "intrinsic" analysis of a set of runs.
                 + 2 sub-commands: 1. "pkdb_pdbs", 2. "user_pdbs", as above.
  - bench_compare  :: Do "extrinsic" comparison of 2 sets of runs.
  - bench_batch    :: Submit a batch of N (10) runs [to be used if scheduler fails].
  - bench_amend_pickle_level :: Correct the conformer-making level in the saved bench_setup cli args file.
  - bench_softlink.sh :: Soft-link customized run.prm, extra.tpl or name.txt files in the current bench_dir
                         as 'run.prm.user', 'extra.tpl' or 'name.txt' in each of the proteins subfolders of
                         bench_dir/runs/.

  - clear_mcce_folder :: Delete all MCCE outputs from a folder.
                         Kept: run.prm, original pdb and prot.pdb, as well as any non-MCCE files.

  - extract_md_frames :: Extract the trajectory's frames with the given indices into pdb files.

  - filesdiff      :: Obtain the column difference between two mcce files, or diff all files in
                      two mcce output folders. The difference file is saved with the 'diff_' prefix.
                      Applicable to these files:
                      all_pK.out, all_sum_crg.out, entropy.out, fort.38, head3.lst, pK.out, 
                      residues_stats.txt, sum_crg.out, vdw0.lst.
  
  - fix_psf_mdanalysis :: Can provide a reformatted PSF file if `MDAnalysis` fails to parse the given psf file.

  - getpdb         :: Download one or more (bioassembly) pdb files from the RSCB Protein Data Bank.

  - glossary       :: Query a glossary of MCCE parameters (based on runprms/run.prm.default).
                      - Search is case-sensitive!
                      - To query for a specific step, the query should be 'StepN', e.g. Step1.
  
  - multiconf_res  :: Given a mcce dirpath, save the list of residues with multiple
                      conformers to file in the same directory.

  - md_clustering  :: Given a topology file and one or more trajectories, save the pdbs of the clusters elements in
                      the topology file's parent directory.

  - precheck       :: Simple check pdb information.

  - postrun        :: Flags problem residues: non-canonical charge, high chi^2 or no fit.

  - ProtInfo       :: Parse an existing pdb file (or the downloaded bioassembly given a pdbid),
                      to report on structural info & findings from step1 log.

  - running_jobs_in_folder.sh :: Given a folder path, list any python jobs running in it and also kill them
                                 if the -K option is used (and precedes the path).
                                 If a second argument is given, e.g. a script name, the listing (and optional killing)
                                 will include it.
                                 Expected usage: Run the command without the kill switch (-K option) first.

  - tcms           :: Tautomeric, topN Charge Micro States
                      Create the related pdb files & the files listing the N vectors.
                      Minimal input: a pdb name if called inside a mcce output folder, else a 
                      pdb filepath. Defaults: pH=7.0; n_top=5; --overwrite=False. Example:
                      > tcms path/to/input.pdb
