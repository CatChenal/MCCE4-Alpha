Tools in MCCE4/MCCE_bin - Last updated: 04/08/25:
  - bench_setup    :: Setup a dataset for multiple runs & write 'prerun' report.
                + 4 sub-commands:
                  0. "pdbids"
                      To show & save the list of available pdbids.
                      
                  1. "pkdb_pdbs"
                      Sub-command for setting up <bench_dir>/runs folder
                      using the pdbs in pKaDBv1 & job_name_run.sh script.

                  2. "user_pdbs"
                      Sub-command for setting up <bench_dir>/runs folder
                      using the user's pdbs & job_name_run.sh script.

                  3. "launch"
                      Sub-command for scheduling the processing of the set.
                      Can be by-passed if 1. or 2. have the --launch flag, meaning 'launch now';
                      => No chance to review the pre-run report!
  
  - bench_analyze  :: Do "intrinsic" analysis of a set of runs.
                 + 2 sub-commands: 1. "pkdb_pdbs", 2. "user_pdbs", as above.
  - bench_compare  :: Do "extrinsic" comparison of 2 sets of runs.
  - bench_batch    :: Submit a batch of N (10) runs [to be used if scheduler fails].
  - bench_amend_pickle_level :: Change the conformer-making level in the saved bench_setup cli args file.
  - bench_softlink.sh :: Soft-link customized run.prm, extra.tpl or name.txt files in the current bench_dir
                         as 'run.prm.user', 'extra.tpl' or 'name.txt' in each of the proteins subfolders of
                         bench_dir/runs/.

  - glossary       :: Query a glossary of MCCE parameters.
                      - Search is case-sensitive!
                      - To query for a specific step, the query should be 'StepN', e.g. Step0.

  - precheck       :: Simple check pdb information.

  - protinfo       :: Parse pdb structure, run step1.py and parse log to create report.

  - running_jobs_in_folder.sh :: Given a folder path, list any python jobs running in it and also kill them
                                 if the -K option is used (and precedes the path).
                                 If a second argument is given, e.g. a script name, the listing (and optional killing)
                                 will include it.
                                 Expected usage: Run the command without the kill switch (-K option) first.
